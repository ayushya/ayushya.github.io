# Intro

I am a highly skilled full-stack engineer with over 9 years of experience in architecting and developing scalable, high-performance web applications. I specialize in delivering pixel-perfect UI/UX through the implementation of React and Angular-based single-page applications (SPAs). My work is characterized by a strong emphasis on maintainability, reusability, and rigorous testing practices. Additionally, I have successfully mentored and developed the careers of over 10 engineers at Instamojo, contributing to a culture of excellence and continuous improvement.
